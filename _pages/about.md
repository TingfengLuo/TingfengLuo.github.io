I am a junior at UIUC majoring in computer science, advised by Prof. Jiawei Han. In the past, I have interned at Pfizer working on post-market antibiotics synthesis optimization with Dr. Fu Liao. Before that, I worked with Prof. Kelly Teske at Western Michigan University, conducting research in preclinical development of immunotherapy for colorectal cancer.

**Research Interests**: I am passionate about leveraging AI to advance scientific discovery, with a particular focus on drug discovery, chemistry, and biology. Drawing upon my previous experience in drug discovery research, I aim to develop innovative machine learning tools that can be seamlessly integrated into real-world clinical/drug discovery settings, enhancing efficiency and outcomes in healthcare.
