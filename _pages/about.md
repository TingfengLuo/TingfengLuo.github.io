I'm a senior at UIUC majoring in computer science, working at [Molecule Maker Lab Institute](https://moleculemaker.org/), advised by [Prof. Jiawei Han](https://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). I'm also working with [Prof. Tal August](https://talaugust.github.io/) on automatically adapting languages in interdisplinary communication within science domains. 

In the past, I have interned at Pfizer working on post-market antibiotics synthesis optimization. Before that, I worked on preclinical development of immunotherapy for colorectal cancer at Western Michigan University.

### Research Interests: 
I am generally interested in **AI for scientific discovery**, with a particular focus on **drug discovery** and **healthcare**. I'm also interested in bridging **communication gaps** between knowledge intensive domains. 

Some topics I'm currently following: 
  * Fine-grained information retrieval for scientific literature 
  * Automatic language adaption in cross-domain communication
  * Generative model for drug candidates conditioned on ADMET and synthetical accessibility
